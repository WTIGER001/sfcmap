# Game Systems Design

Game systems are the core rules, confurations and assets that come with each game from that game system. Everything from how the lighting works and what roll is made for initiative to the standard monsters and items. 

> **Design Decision**: Game systems are too complex to have completely dynamic. So the decison was made to make them static (compiled into the code) with some customizations.
